        <p>Peter Gene Hernandez (born October 8, 1985), known professionally as Bruno Mars, is an American
            singer-songwriter. He is known for his stage performances, retro showmanship, and for performing in a wide
            range of musical styles, including pop, R&B, funk, soul, reggae, disco, and rock. Mars is accompanied by his
            band, the Hooligans, who play a variety of instruments, such as electric guitar, bass, piano, keyboards,
            drums, and horns, and also serve as backup singers and disco dancers. In 2021, he collaborated with Anderson
            .Paak, as the American musical superduo Silk Sonic. </p>
        <p>Born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, Mars moved to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a musical career. Following
            a brief contract with Motown Records, he first established his name in the music industry as a songwriter
            and co-founder of the production team the Smeezingtons, responsible for singles for Mars himself and other
            artists. He rose to fame as a solo artist in 2010 buoyed by the success of "Nothin' on You" by B.o.B and
            "Billionaire" by Travie McCoy, both of which featured his vocals. In the same year, Mars released his debut
            studio album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, which blended pop with reggae and R&B. It spawned the international
            number-one singles "Just the Way You Are", "Grenade", and "The Lazy Song". Drawing inspiration from disco,
            funk, rock, reggae and soul genres, his second studio album, Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), was his first number
            one on the Billboard 200. It amassed two Billboard Hot 100 number-one songs, "Locked Out of Heaven" and
            "When I Was Your Man".

            In 2014, Mars was featured on Mark Ronson's "Uptown Funk", which topped various music charts, spending a
            total of fourteen and seven weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, respectively. Mars's
            third studio album, the R&B-focused 24K Magic (2016), received seven Grammy Awards, winning the major
            categories of Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year. The album also yielded the
            top-five singles "24K Magic", "That's What I Like" (his seventh Billboard Hot 100 number-one single), and a
            remix of "Finesse" featuring Cardi B. In 2021, Mars and Anderson .Paak, as Silk Sonic, released the
            collaborative studio album An Evening with Silk Sonic, which delved into 1970s R&B and soul and was led by
            the chart-topping single "Leave the Door Open". It received four Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year
            and Song of the Year.</p>
